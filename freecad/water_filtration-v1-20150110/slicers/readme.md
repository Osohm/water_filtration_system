Slicer Configuration Files
--------------------------

Note these were the starting point for me
and you may use them as such for you as well, 
fine tuning is always necessary to get the 
best performance with your slicer and particular 
3D printer.

Slicer configuration files both for CuraEngine 
and Slic3r.
